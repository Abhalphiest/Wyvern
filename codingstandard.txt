# naming conventions

-> End-user facing functions and classes should use camel case, i.e. GetThisMemberVariable() and SampleClass
-> Internal functions and classes should be distinguished by using underscores and lowercase, i.e. dont_call_this_externally() and c_media_manager.

prefixes: c == class, k == constant, s == struct, m == member, p == parameter, i == interface, etc.
