Disclaimer:
	I am a student, and am primarily self taught when it comes to engine programming
	and C++ at this point in time. Please excuse my code for being non-optimal, I assure you
	that I am always learning and would love to be contacted regarding any concerning code in this project.

Implemented:
	Input Master Singleton
	Shader Master Singleton
	Camera Singleton + Simple Camera Functions
	Window Master Singleton
