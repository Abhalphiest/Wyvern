Thank you very much to Dr. David Schwartz, Professor Alberto Bobadilla, Dr. Jay Alan Jackson, and the rest of the wonderful faculty and student body of RIT.
 All code is mine, but I could not have written it without their guidance or instruction.

Disclaimer:
	I am a student, and am primarily self taught when it comes to engine programming and C++ at this point in time. Please excuse my code for being non-optimal, I assure you that I am always learning and would love to be contacted regarding any concerning code in this project.

Implemented:
	Input Master Singleton
	Shader Master Singleton
	Camera Singleton + Simple Camera Functions
	Window Master Singleton
	Mesh Primitive Vertex Generation
	Indexed Rendering
	Rudimentary Mesh Class
	Material Manager (kind of)
	Mesh Manager
	Obj loading
	Instance rendering


Currently Working On:
	Textures
	Time Singleton
	Object Class
	Primitive UV generation

After that comes:
	More sophisticated Input Handling
	More complex shading
	Normal Maps
	Text Rendering
	A tech demo
	Physics
	..and much, much more!
